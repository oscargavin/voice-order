Approach to the phone call:

Things that we need to know to process the order:
Customer / account code
Delivery date
Products they want

We basically need a waterfall for determining these things in a smooth way. I'm thinking in this order:

Customer / account code:
"Hi, you've reached orders at OpenInfo Foodservice, where are you calling from today?"
They say customer name or account code
If they don't say customer name, then we can match on this and verify account code

Delivery date
When would you like this delivered for?
'Next Wednesday'
"So that's Wednesday 12th March".

Products
"And What would you like?"
'2 boxes of tomatoes, 5 boxes of this, 10 of that.'

"Great, order received - we'll let you know once this is confirmed by the team and send a confirmation to this number and the email address we have on record. Have a nice day!"
